# Instagram Automation System Guide

## Overview

The Instagram Automation System allows you to create automated responses and actions for your Instagram content. When specific triggers occur (like comments, DMs, mentions, etc.), the system automatically performs configured actions (like sending DMs, liking comments, following users, etc.).

- **Status**: Set whether the automation is active or inactive

#### Step 2: Trigger & Action Configuration
- **Trigger Type**: Choose what event triggers the automation
  - **Comment**: Triggers when someone comments on your post
  - **Direct Message**: Triggers when someone sends you a DM
  - **Mention**: Triggers when someone mentions you
  - **Like**: Triggers when someone likes your post
  - **Follow**: Triggers when someone follows you

When an Instagram event occurs:
