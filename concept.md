Modular Architecture Overview
SOLID Principles Implementation:
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each component has one clear responsibility
Data fetching is separated from UI display
State management is isolated in Zustand store
Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Components are extensible without modification
New features can be added through props
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Components can be replaced with alternatives
Interface contracts are maintained
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Components only receive props they need
No forced dependencies
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
Dependencies are injected through props
üìÅ File Structure Created:
Apply to Content.jsx
üîÑ Data Flow Architecture:
Data Fetching Layer (contentService.js)
Handles API calls and data transformation
Provides mock data for development
Easy to switch to real API endpoints
State Management Layer (contentStore.js)
Zustand store for centralized state
CRUD operations for content
Computed selectors for filtered views
Presentation Layer (Components)
Pure UI components with props-based configuration
No business logic in components
Reusable across the application
‚ú® Key Features:
Real Data Ready: Easy to switch from mock to real API
Zustand Integration: Following your preference for Zustand
Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach
Error Handling: Graceful error states
Loading States: Proper loading indicators
Form Validation: Client-side validation
Modular Components: Each component is independently testable
